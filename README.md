# House Price Prediction using Linear Regression

## Overview
This project is a *House Price Prediction Model* built using *Linear Regression* in Python. The goal is to develop a predictive model that estimates house prices based on various features such as location, size, number of bedrooms, and other influencing factors. The model achieved an accuracy of *1.00*, indicating a perfect fit on the dataset.

## Dataset
The dataset used for this project contains various attributes affecting house prices, including:
- **House Size (sq ft)**
- **Number of rooms**
- **Number of conveniences**
- **Location**
- **Building Age**
- **Distance to Center**
- **Price** (Target Variable)

### Data Source
The dataset was sourced from *writing a python code to generate a syntethic dataset to carry on this project*, and was preprocessed before training the model.

## Technologies Used
- **Python**
- **Pandas** (Data Manipulation)
- **NumPy** (Numerical Computation)
- **Matplotlib & Seaborn** (Data Visualization)
- **Scikit-Learn** (Model Training & Evaluation)

## Data Preprocessing
Before training the model, the dataset was cleaned and prepared:
1. **Handling Missing Values**: Missing data was imputed using the mean/mode where necessary.
2. **Encoding Categorical Variables**: Converted categorical features (like neighborhood rating) into numerical values.
3. **Feature Scaling**: Standardized numerical features to ensure better model performance.
4. **Outlier Removal**: Detected and removed extreme values that could affect model accuracy.

## Model Building
The model was built using *Linear Regression* due to its simplicity and effectiveness for this type of predictive analysis.

### Steps Taken:
1. **Split the Data**: The dataset was split into training (80%) and testing (20%) sets.
2. **Feature Selection**: Selected the most relevant features for model training.
3. **Training the Model**: Used Scikit-learn's LinearRegression model to fit the training data.
4. **Model Evaluation**: Measured model performance using metrics like:
   - **R-squared Score (R²)**
   - **Mean Absolute Error (MAE)**
   - **Mean Squared Error (MSE)**
   - **Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE)**

## Model Performance
- **R² Score**: 1.00 (Indicating a perfect model fit)
- **Mean Absolute Error (MAE)**: 0.0
- **Mean Squared Error (MSE)**: 0.0
- **Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE)**: 0.0

The model achieved **100% accuracy**, meaning it perfectly predicts house prices on the given dataset. However, such a high score could indicate potential overfitting, requiring further validation on unseen data.

## Results & Insights
- The most influential factors in house pricing included *house size, **number of bedrooms**, and  **location**.
- The model successfully captured linear relationships between features and price.
- A perfect accuracy score suggests the dataset might be too small or lacks variance, which may require further testing with real-world data.

## How to Run the Project
1. Clone the repository:
   sh
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/house-price-prediction.git
   cd house-price-prediction
   
2. Install dependencies:
   sh
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   
3. Run the Jupyter Notebook or Python script:
   sh
   jupyter notebook House_Price_Prediction.ipynb
   
   or
   sh
   python house_price_prediction.py
   

## Future Improvements
- **Collect and Use a Larger Dataset** to validate the model on real-world data.
- **Apply Regularization Techniques** (Ridge or Lasso Regression) to avoid overfitting.
- **Try Advanced Models** like Random Forest, XGBoost, or Neural Networks for better performance.
- **Deploy the Model** using Flask or FastAPI to make it accessible via a web app.

## Conclusion
This project successfully demonstrates how *Linear Regression* can be used to predict house prices with high accuracy. While achieving an R² score of *1.00* is ideal, further testing on different datasets is recommended to ensure model robustness.
